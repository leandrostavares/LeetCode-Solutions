# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).  
Each problem has its own folder, with one or more subfolders representing different implementation styles (e.g., procedural, object-oriented, functional).

## 📁 Structure

- Problem folders are prefixed with their LeetCode number for easier navigation.
- Each subfolder contains a specific approach to solving the problem.
- Local `README.md` files describe the problem and my thought process.

---

## 🚧 Ongoing Goals

- Refactor procedural solutions to object-oriented versions
- Improve performance or readability over time
- Add test cases and complexity analysis

---

## 📌 Notes

- These are personal solutions and may not represent optimal code.
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
